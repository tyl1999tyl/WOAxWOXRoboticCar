Our project is to assemble an autonomous driving car that is able to help with pesticide control in a farm. The car will be able to traverse from the location of one crop to another in the shortest distance possible. The algorithm that we are using to find the shortest distance is a path finding algorithm called Floydâ€“Warshall.
Below shows an example of the farm and its distance matrix:
